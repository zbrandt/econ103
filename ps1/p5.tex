\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Consider an \(n \times n\) chessboard (the figure below shows an example with \(n = 8\)).

    % You may want to include the chessboard image here if needed

    Show that if \(n\) is a power of 2 it is possible to cover the board with L-shaped
    trominoes (consisting of three squares each, shown in blue) so that all but one
    of the squares on the board is covered.
