\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let \(X\) be a nonempty set, and let \(2^X\) denote the set of all subsets of \(X\). Show
    that there is no onto (aka surjective) function \(f : X \mapsto 2^X\). (The function \(f\) is
    surjective if for every set \(A \in 2^X\) there is an \(x \in X\) such that \(f(x) = A\).)
