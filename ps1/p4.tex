\begin{homeworkProblem}
    A pair \(G = (V, E)\) is a \textit{directed graph} if \(V\) is a set and \(E \subset V \times V\). The graph
    \(G\) has a cycle if there exists an integer \(n \geq 1\) and elements \(v_1, \ldots, v_n \in V\) such
    that \((v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), \ldots, (v_{n-1}, v_n), (v_n, v_1) \in E\). Show that if \(V\) is a non-empty
    finite set and for all \(v \in V\) there is \(v' \in V\) such that \((v, v') \in E\), then \(G\) has a
    cycle.
